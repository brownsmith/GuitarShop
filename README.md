# GuitarShop
Dummy ecommerce website built using React

## Pre-requisites:
An up-to-date version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= version 6

## To run the app:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/brownsmith/GuitarShop.git
cd GuitarShop/my-app
yarn
yarn start
```
## To run the tests:

GuitarShop uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as its test runner. Jest is a Node-based runner. This means that the tests always run in a Node environment and not in a real browser.

```sh
yarn test
```
## What’s Included?

Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern single-page React app:

* React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax support.
* Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
* Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need `-webkit-` or other prefixes.
* A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
* A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
* A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.
* An offline-first [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers) and a [web app manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/), meeting all the [Progressive Web App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) criteria.
* Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.
